          </div>
          <div class="step-description">
            <p>Learning how to fish is overwhelming. The act of dropping a line is easy, but being a successful angler is hard. That’s why they call it fishing and not catching. The <b>3 biggest challenges</b> in fishing for beginners are <b>finding fish</b>, <b>tying on the right fishing tackle</b>,
              and <b>using the best technique</b> to catch fish on that tackle. This guide breaks down all 3 challenges and gives you step by step directions for your first fishing trip.
              Our team of fishing guides gives you exact recommendations on what to use and how to use it so you start catching fish right away without breaking the bank.</p>

          <div class="step-description">
            <p>In the beginning, your <b>goal</b> is to start catching fish in the <b>easiest way</b> possible. There is a lot that goes into learning the basics. Nailing the basics of fishing is best done by catching a smaller species like Panfish near the shore.</p>

            <h2>Find a place to Fish</h2>
          </div>
          <div class="step-description">
            <p>Start <b>googling</b> to <b>find</b> a <b>public area</b> that has shore access available for fishing. If the public location has a dock or pier access the better. Start by <b>searching</b> your “<b>county or city</b>” + “<b>public fishing access</b>”.
              A lot of <b>State DNR</b> websites have “<b>Lake Finders</b>” or other tools to search for public fishing access near your town.
              While fishing off the beaten path is a scenic ideal, you should focus on finding a <b>location</b> that is <b>convenient</b>. This way you can focus on fishing and avoid complications.
              Many local parks have <b>stocked ponds</b> and <b>small lakes</b> with <b>convenient public fishing access</b>. Restrooms, short distances, and stocked Panfish make up the ideal location at this point in your journey.</p>

            <h2>Basic Fishing Tackle: Hooks, Sinkers and Bobbers</h2>
          </div>
          <div class="step-description">
            <p>You need <b>hooks</b>, <b>sinkers</b>, and some <b>snap bobbers</b>. Nothing too fancy, just the right collection of <b>bait holder hooks</b>, <b>split shot sinkers</b> and some <b>small snap bobbers</b>. For the first few trips this basic rig will land you some <b>Panfish</b>:<br><br>
              This <b>simple setup</b> should be baited with a <b>1″ piece of worm</b>. <b>Tie your hook</b> by simply double knotting it, you can learn the Clinch Knot later. <b>Double knotting the hook</b> will work fine for the Panfish.
              <b>Pinch</b> your 3/0 Split Shot sinker about 1 ft. above the hook and <b>snap</b> on your bobber through both loops, about 2-3 ft. above your sinker.</p>

              <b>Pierce</b> the <b>worm piece</b> once more on the other end, securing it to your barb, but covering the point of the hook.</p>

            <p>If a <b>dock</b> or <b>deeper water</b> is <b>not accessible</b> on your first trip, you will need to <b>learn how to cast</b>. <b>Hold the rod</b> in your throwing hand, with the reel’s shaft in-between your middle and ring finger.
              <b>Open the bail</b> with your opposite hand while <b>pinching</b> the line between your index finger and the rod handle with the hand gripping the rod. Slowly, <b>direct your rod</b> to the side of your body at <b>45 degrees</b>.
              Gradually <b>bring the rod</b> back to center with your body, <b>releasing</b> the finger that’s pinching your line once the momentum of your rod is in front of you.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="step-description">
            <p>The <b>bait</b> is now out in the water, and all your hard work should start to pay off. If you are using the <b>basic bobber rig</b>, you should see your bobber <b>halfway submerged</b>,
              with the <b>top half</b> above the water and the bottom half underwater. Make sure your <b>baited hook</b> is at least <b>1 foot off</b> of the bottom. If your bobber is submerged <b>without a bite</b>,
              you have added <b>too much weight</b> with your <b>sinker</b> or the <b>bobber</b> is too <b>small</b>.</p>

          <div class="step-title">
            <h2>How to Tell if You Have a Bite</h2>
          </div>
          <div class="step-description">
            <p>You will <b>notice</b> that you are getting a <b>bite</b> when your bobber <b>moves up</b> and <b>down</b>, or <b>drives</b> to <b>one side</b> or <b>the other</b>. Let the fish take the bait. Give the bite a <b>5-10 second count</b> if your bobber is not completely submerged.
               <b>Small Panfish</b> do <b>not have the strength</b> to completely submerge your bobber. Their <b>mouths</b> are very small, and they <b>suck in</b> and <b>push out</b> food with their gills.
               You likely have a <b>fish hooked</b> if the <b>bobber moves erratically</b> for <b>over 5 seconds</b>. If you do not give it <b>5 seconds</b>, you run the risk of pulling the bait out of the fish's mouth while it exhales.
               The feeling for when to set the hook will develop over time.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="step-description">
            <p>After you have <b>confirmed</b> the <b>5 second rule</b>, you need to <b>set your hook</b>. Start by <b>slowly reeling</b> in your line until it is <b>taut</b>. <b>Gently lift</b> your rod tip a few inches to connect with the fish and set the hook into its mouth.
              This is not the BassMaster Classic, <b>do not over do it</b>. You are reeling in a healthy and vibrant Sunfish and you want to <b>keep them healthy</b> and <b>vibrant</b>. <b>Gradually reel</b> the fish in, guiding your rod with the movement of the fish and monitoring your line’s tension.
              When the <b>fish</b> starts to <b>surface</b>, <b>lift them</b> by your rod above the dock or ground. Be careful <b>not to reel</b> in <b>too much</b> slack or your bobber will get stuck on the top of your rod’s guide. Your line will break and you will lose your catch before properly releasing it.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="step-title">
            <h2>Keep your Catch Off the Ground</h2>
          </div>
          <div class="step-description">
            <p>Once your <b>fish is out of the water</b>, try <b>not to contact it</b> with the dock or ground.  Keep it <b>propped in the air</b> as you gently place the palm of your hand underneath its belly and wrap your fingers around its body.
              <b>Panfish spines</b> are sharp, and can poke easily. Be careful to wrap your hands around the belly and hold it in a cradling form with the spine pointed upwards.<br>
              Having <b>pliers</b> is a <b>convenient tool</b> for removing the <b>hook</b> and you should buy one. However, I understand that the budget is tight for a first time angler and making another purchase is a tall order.
              So if you do not have a pair of pliers, the best method to <b>remove a hook from a fish</b> is to <b>rotate the hook</b> so the barb gets close to the surface, then <b>push down on the hook</b> until the barb pops back through where the hook entered.
              The hook should now be in the fish’s mouth, so <b>gently rotate the hook</b> once more so it clears the entrance of the mouth.</p>
